// pipelines from its pipeline manifest, ~1 s of NVIDIA's compiler each. In the emulator's process
// the threads that create them run off the cores of the pinned GPU threads (its default CPU sets)
// and below the game's own busy threads, which leave them about two cores: the game reached its
// world after 821 s, and then stalled for seconds on pipelines. Helpers run at the priority of the
// emulator's threads on all of its processors, the second threads of the reserved cores included:
// ~6 pipelines/s, the world after 463 s, and no stall over 0.2 s there.

// A helper is this executable started with --pipeline-helper: it creates a device like the
// emulator's (CreateHeadlessVulkan) and, for each module it is sent, the pipeline in an empty
// pipeline cache, whose data it sends back. Creating the pipeline from that data takes the
// emulator ~2 ms. Each helper has a driver disk cache of its own, removed when it exits, and exits
// after a number of pipelines: once its disk cache holds many, NVIDIA's driver may compress the
// binaries with a dictionary kept there, which the emulator does not have. Windows only.
