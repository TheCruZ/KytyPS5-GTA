// stream asks for it (EVENT_WRITE CS_PARTIAL_FLUSH, ACQUIRE_MEM, RELEASE_MEM, WAIT_REG_MEM, ...).
// The renderer put a full barrier before and after every dispatch instead, so the async compute
// chains of hundreds of tiny dispatches ran one at a time with the GPU draining between them
// (the title: ~640 indirect dispatches of 0xbad108e74fb72e9f, 28 ms of GPU time, plus ~25 ms of
// gaps, a frame). A run is a sequence of dispatches separated only by SET_SH_REG and debug-marker
// packets: inside it the barriers between the dispatches are left out, the thread counts of its
// indirect dispatches are converted together, and the barrier after the run's last dispatch
// orders the whole run for what follows.
